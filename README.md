Dashboard for python implementations

This is a dashboard to test different python functionalities and move towards first integrations.

1. Functionality
2. First integrations
3. Second integrations
4. Advanced (eventually to be outsourced in own projects

The general goal is to have some tool framework that transforms „any input“ (of more or less structured text) into „any output“ (of text storage in files or databases) for later preprocessing (natural language processing).

For efficiency the development is to reduce the scope to data sets and data structures „of interest“.

The design is open in the sense that, missing parts are kept to be done „by hand“. This „open design“ is eventually enforced „by design“, even when an automatization would be possible.
